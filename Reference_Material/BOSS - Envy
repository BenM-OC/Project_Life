ENVY
	Envy should be the boss of the pit area, it would make sense to stage his blindness/envy/self loathing in a dark area w/o a lot of sun. 

	Combat Info: 
		Because he pry's the eyeballs out of people he kid-naps from the mines, he should have an attack that is telagraphed, but if it hits it is a OHKO cause he goes for the Protag's eyes.

		If its going to be in the pit or a part of a tunnel system off of the pit we should incorperate an attack that has to do with his lair
