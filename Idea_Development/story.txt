OverArching Idea: 
	- The 7 Main Bosses of the game are manifestations of the 7 Deadly Sins
	- Each boss causes issues for the inhabitents of the sub-section of the map in which they preside. 
	- The map overall is supposed to be a metaphor for the players mental health, in the beginning it's plagued with issues, but as the player matures (beats the deadly sins, metaphorically ridding them from their life) the overall world is improved for it's inhabitants and therefor the players mental state improves
	- The final boss is self-doubt/self-hatred, the messaging being that it's a negative outlook on life and our unwillingness to enact change when we're unhappy that causes us to sin and in general be unhappy.
